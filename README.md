The term HTTP stands for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It's mainly responsible for communication between clients and servers on the web.

An HTTP request is mainly made by a client on the web: web browsers. An HTTP response is done by the server where these browsers are hosted.

Status codes have different meanings in HTTP; the code displayed on my screen was 200, which meant that my HTTP request was successfully completed.

Git is quite interesting, I must say. It's like cmd for Windows but with a twist; most of the commands and prompts are tailored to meet different functions, which mainly help us users to push, pull, add, and commit work on GitHub.
One thing I learned from Git is that conflicts with repositories may end up giving you a hard time but I guess that's what every app comes with: being able to learn and practice more.
